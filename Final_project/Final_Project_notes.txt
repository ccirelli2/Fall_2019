DATASETS ------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	MNIST	70,000 handwritten documents
		http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
		Used in deep learning since 1998
2.	IAM 	Online Handwritting Database
		Includes demographic information on the authors. 


TOPICS 	-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Shift toward digital stylus - gives more information such as pen stroke, pressure and
	speed of writing. 		
2.	Historical documents, acrhives, or mass digitization of hand filled forms. 
3.	Identifying demographics based on handwritting styles. 



QUESTION ------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	What about trying to recognize a document that includes text from a computer and
	handwritting?
2.	What about real time translation of handwritting?
3.	How are multiple kernels used in a CNN to identify features?
4.	Do we need a study that not only establishes the individuality of handwriting, but
	one that shows variations in gender and those that are right/left handed. 


HISTORY -------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Ref: Have we solved the problem of handwriting recognition?  
	- Handwritting recognition was first used for classification of postal mail. 
	- The ﬁrst Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software developed in 1974 by Ray Kurzwei
	- Challeges:	lacked efficiency and knowledge of unexpeted characters.
			
2.	First paper to introduce NN to handwriting recognition
			Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner
			"Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Regonition"
			Published Nov 1998

3.	Pique of Accuracy
			2011 w/ Ciresan analysed handwriting achieving a tiny 0.27% error rate. 
			https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6065487

CHALLENGES ---------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Ref: Have we solved
	- Character extraction	Individual characters are recognised by eas with OCR. 
				Cursive handwriting, which is connected, poses more issues
				with evaluation. Diff w/ no separation between characters. 
	- Feature Extraction	Indv properties of characters were hard coded. Aspect ratio
				pixel distribution, number of strokes, distance from image 
				cetner.  


TECHNIQUES ---------------------------------------------------------------
1.	CNN			Used by authors of Gender and Handedness Prediction 
				from Offline Handwritting Using Convolutional
				Nueral Networks.

2.	RNN / LSTM		Google Approach

 

SUMMARY PAPERS OF INTEREST -----------------------------------------------

1.	Handwriting Using CNN	https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/3891624/
				Application for Forensic Biometrics. 
				Study focused on stability of CNN for three demographic 	
				problems: gender, handedness and combined. 
				First every approach to trying to predict gender + handedness. 
				Apparently this study obtained the best results to date. 

2.	Google RNN-Based Handwriting Recognition in Gboard
				More recent work focuses on RNN variants such as Long-Short
				Term Memory networks (LSTMs). 
				"the deep learning revolution has swept away most feature
				engineering efforts and replaced them with learned 
				learned representations in many domains..."
				Replaces their previous segment and decode system. 
				Consists of a stack of bidirectional LSTMs
