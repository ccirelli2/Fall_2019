DATASETS ------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	MNIST	70,000 handwritten documents
		http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
		Used in deep learning since 1998
2.	IAM 	Online Handwritting Database
		Includes demographic information on the authors. 



HISTORY -------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Ref: Have we solved the problem of handwriting recognition?  
	- Handwritting recognition was first used for classification of postal mail. 
	- The ﬁrst Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software developed in 1974 by Ray Kurzwei
	- Challeges:	lacked efficiency and knowledge of unexpeted characters.
			
2.	First paper to introduce NN to handwriting recognition
			Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner
			"Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Regonition"
			Published Nov 1998

3.	Pique of Accuracy
			2011 w/ Ciresan analysed handwriting achieving a tiny 0.27% error rate.

SUMMARY PAPERS OF INTEREST -----------------------------------------------

1.	Handwriting Using CNN	https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2018/3891624/
				Application for Forensic Biometrics. 
				Study focused on stability of CNN for three demographic 	
				problems: gender, handedness and combined. 
				First every approach to trying to predict gender + handedness. 
				Apparently this study obtained the best results to date. 

2.	Google RNN-Based Handwriting Recognition in Gboard
				More recent work focuses on RNN variants such as Long-Short
				Term Memory networks (LSTMs). 
				"the deep learning revolution has swept away most feature
				engineering efforts and replaced them with learned 
				learned representations in many domains..."
				Replaces their previous segment and decode system. 
				Consists of a stack of bidirectional LSTMs
