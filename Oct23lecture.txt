Text Documents:

Bag of words:		impartial to the oder of the words.  Just a mixed bag of words.
			words lose their meaning.  Hotel & Motel have 0 similarity in bag of words. 
 
Tf-idf Matrix:		term frequency matrix
			idf = if a word appears a lot of times it is discounted. 
			idf = # documents / # documents containing word

*Idea			What about setting up a matrix to compare the connectivity of words in a document and 
			try to see if there is a difference in the connectivity between two document types.
			We could use a clustering algorith to see this. 

Markov Assumption	Uses conditional probabilities to calculate the next word.  Markov Assumption
			uses a window of only so many words. 

Skip Gram		Given context word, what is the word that comes before or after. 


Embedding layer		convert one hot encoding into dense layer?


Cosine Similarity	You can either use the distance between two angels or the angel. 
			Cosine is better as it not affected by the frequency of the words.

Singular value decomposition
	

LSA?
